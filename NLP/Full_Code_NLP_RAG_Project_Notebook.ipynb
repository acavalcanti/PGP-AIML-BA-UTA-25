            "3. Immunotherapy: This involves using medications that stimulate the immune system to promote hair growth. Immunotherapy can be in the form of injections, topical creams or ointments, or oral medications.\n",
            "4. Phototherapy: Exposure to specific wavelengths of light, such as UVB or UVA, can help stimulate hair growth and slow down hair loss. This treatment is often used in combination with other treatments.\n",
            "5. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy: This involves injecting platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the affected area to stimulate hair growth. PRP contains growth factors that can help promote hair growth and reduce inflammation.\n",

            " Sudden patchy hair loss, also known as alopecia areata, can be a distressing condition that affects both men and women. Here are some effective treatments and solutions for addressing sudden patchy hair loss:\n",
            "Trecommended Treatments:\n",
            "1. Topical Corticosteroids: Applying topical corticosteroids to the affected area can help reduce inflammation and promote hair growth. Studies have shown that corticosteroid injections can lead to a 70% response rate in patients with alopecia areata (Liu et al., 2018).\n",
            "2. Minoxidil: Minoxidil is a solution that can be applied directly to the affected area to stimulate hair growth. Studies have shown that minoxidil can lead to a 30% response rate in patients with alopecia areata (Katsambas et al., 2017).\n",
            "3. Anthralin: Anthralin is a medication that can be applied topically or taken orally to reduce inflammation and promote hair growth. Studies have shown that anthralin can lead to a 50% response rate in patients with alopecia areata (Katsambas et al., 2017).\n",
            "4. Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy, such as diphencyprone (DPCP), can be used to stimulate the immune system and promote hair growth. Studies have shown that DPCP can lead to a 60% response rate in patients with alopecia areata (Katsambas et al., 2017).\n",
            "5. Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy: PRP therapy involves injecting platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the affected area to stimulate hair growth. Studies have shown that PRP therapy can lead to a 40% response rate in patients with alopecia areata (Katsambas et al., 2017).\n",
            "Possible Causes:\n",
            "1. Autoimmune Disorders: Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder, which means that the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy hair follicles, leading to hair loss.\n",
            "2. Genetics: There may be a genetic component to alopecia areata, as it can run in families.\n",
            "3. Stress: Stress has been linked to an increased risk of developing alopecia areata.\n",
            "4. Hormonal Imbalances: Hormonal imbalances, such as thyroid disorders or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), can increase the risk of developing alopecia areata.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Grounding to CONTEXT only (System).\n",

        "3. Inline citations + Sources section (System).\n",
        "Asking for [S1]...[Sk] tags forces the model to point to exact snippets. We can also then map [Si] -> (file, page) from metadata and display page numbers—great for auditability and user trust.\n",

        "4. Fixed, clinical style + sections (System).\n",

        "6. Patient summary (optional) (User).\n",
        "A slot for {patient_summary} lets us provide succinct clinical context when we have it, but doesn't force it; the LLM still must ground everything in the CONTEXT snippets.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Retrieval Pipeline Effectiveness\n",
        "\n",
        "- Observation: Most low scores (1/5) originated from retrieval gaps, not generation. The model's reasoning was coherent whenever correct evidence appeared in the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Insight: Our RAG pipeline's bottleneck is recall quality, not LLM accuracy. Improving retrieval directly boosts groundedness.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Action: Keep the MinimalRetriever wrapper and maintain its current K_FETCH=20, anchor guarantee, and boosted queries. This already addresses ~80% of the score variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Chunking Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "- Observation: No evidence of chunk fragmentation issues—the context returned sufficient scope per query.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Insight: Current chunk size and overlap are adequate for this medical-QA domain. Adjusting chunking would bring marginal gain compared with retriever optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Action: Retain our present chunking; revisit only if we later ingest multi-page or multimodal PDFs (e.g., clinical images + text).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. LLM Evaluation Behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "- Observation: The Mistral model provided consistent and explainable scoring for groundedness and relevance when guided by clear, escaped JSON templates.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Insight: The LLM-as-a-Judge layer is now stable enough for automated regression testing. It can serve as a continuous-evaluation component for new prompts or retriever variants.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Action: Wrap our evaluation function into a batch job that runs nightly or per-query update, logging JSON outputs to track score trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. System Design Simplification\n",
        "\n",
        "- Observation: Removing LangChain dependencies significantly reduced code complexity without losing capability. (I decided to remove due to some errors which were preventing me to advance. It was a decision to avoid losing more time making LangChain work)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Insight: The lean architecture (direct Chroma + SentenceTransformer + MinimalRetriever + Mistral) is sustainable for local or cloud deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Action: Keep the lightweight design; containerize it for portability (Docker/Podman) and integrate with OpenShift AI for production evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Groundedness vs Relevance Patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "- Observation:\n",
        "  - Groundedness averaged 4/5 due to partial retrieval coverage.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Relevance averaged 4.6/5 — strong alignment with questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Insight: The assistant's understanding of topic scope is excellent; only evidence density limits the scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Action: Add a reranker or lightweight hybrid BM25 + embedding retrieval stage once the current pipeline is stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Business Recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Automate Evaluation as a Product Metric\n",
        "Transform our LLM-as-Judge evaluation into a dashboard KPI:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Track Groundedness & Relevance scores per topic or corpus section.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use trends to validate data curation improvements and retriever changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Report these metrics as explainable QA quality indicators for stakeholders (e.g., clinical partners, compliance teams).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Operationalize the RAG System\n",
        "\n",
        "- Deploy on Red Hat OpenShift AI using our current containerized setup.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Enable scheduled index refresh jobs (daily/weekly) for updated medical manuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integrate our evaluation pipeline as a post-deployment QA gate to certify new releases.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Extend Domain Coverage & Value\n",
        "\n",
        "- Broaden corpus: ingest treatment guidelines, drug interaction tables, and adverse-event protocols to elevate clinical QA depth.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use the same evaluation scaffold to benchmark future specialized models.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Build a benchmark suite (10-15 recurring questions per specialty) to measure longitudinal quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Strategic ROI & Stakeholder Impact\n",
        "\n",
        "- Business Outcome: Demonstrates a quantifiable, traceable AI-assisted knowledge retrieval framework for healthcare — critical for compliance-oriented clients (Insurance, Telco, Health sectors).\n",
        "\n",
        "- ROI Lever: Automates expert review time, reduces hallucination risk, and provides objective scoring to justify enterprise AI adoption.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Next Step: Pilot this RAG QA Evaluator internally as a proof-of-value module for Red Hat AI Platform or customer AI assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary: This project achieved a stable, explainable, and modular RAG QA evaluation pipeline. The priority now is operational scaling — automating score tracking, enriching data coverage, and positioning this evaluator as a reliability metric for enterprise AI adoption."
