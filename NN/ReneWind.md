Project Rene Wind

Course: Neural Networks

The project aims to create and improve classification models for ReneWind's wind turbine generator failures, enabling proactive maintenance and cost reduction. The models use sensor data to identify potential failures, minimizing false negatives and ensuring turbine repairs before breakdown. The final models are chosen based on their ability to accurately predict failures, providing insights and recommendations to improve maintenance strategies and cost efficiency in wind energy production.

Evaluator

"You have submitted an excellent and well-organized notebook with a clear structure covering the problem statement, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation. Your EDA is thorough, including relevant visualizations, correlation analysis, and meaningful observations. Data preprocessing is correctly handled, with missing values addressed post-split and the test set properly reserved. The model-building process demonstrates strong understanding, with an appropriate evaluation metric, multiple model experiments, detailed observations for each model, and selection of the best-performing model with proper justification. Actionable insights and business recommendations are relevant and thoughtfully provided. Overall, this is a high-quality submission reflecting strong analytical skills, methodical experimentation, and clear presentation."
